Django app for managing the backend of the leben in deutschland mobile app

**NOTE**: 

- The project contains the following important setup files: _requirements.text_, _runtime.txt_.
These two files define the python environment used and the respective libraries used in the project.

- You will need to define a _.env_ file in the root of the repository that will be used in the settings.py file. This file is excluded from version control since it is only meant to be used for development purposes and should store private developer settings. Look at the _.env.example_ for an example of such a file
